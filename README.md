# Minifigs Collection Manager

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### This is a small application to manage your collection of Lego Star Wars minifigs.

The project is currently working with the DB of my collection on firebase and the action only change the state localy but as you can find on the [action file](src/store/actions/minifigs.js) there is example of solution to do it on the DB you choose too use.
You can also find a [json file](minifigs.json) with the DB I have created. I use Firebase for this project but anything is possible if you twerk the code a bit.
